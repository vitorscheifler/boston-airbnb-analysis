## General Info

For this project, I was interested in using the Boston Airbnb dataset to better understand:
 
- Which neighbourhoods are the most expensives?

- How is the distribution of rental properties in the neighbourhoods?

- Which numeric columns have a strong correlation with price?


## Technologies used

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda default of Python. The code runs with no issues using Python 3 versions.

## File Descriptions

There is one notebook with the analysis and exploration of the questions mentioned in the General Info section.

In the folder ``inputs``, there is a csv file named ``listings.csv`` with the data used in my analysis.

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@vitorscheiflerdealmeida/this-will-make-you-get-by-with-airbnb-in-boston-783707e885e3).
